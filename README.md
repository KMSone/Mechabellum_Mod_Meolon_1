_Utilities for practicing Boneworks speedrunning._

## Features

- Makes boss claw always patrol to the area near the finish in Streets
  - Boss claw cabin appears _green_ when this feature is on, so that you're aware RNG is being manipulated

## Installation

- Make sure [Melon Loader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=what-is-melonloader) is installed in Boneworks
- Download [this mod from Thunderstore](https://boneworks.thunderstore.io/package/jakzo/SpeedrunTools/) (click on "Manual Download")
- Open the downloaded `.zip` file and extract `Mods/SpeedrunTools.dll` into `BONEWORKS/Mods/SpeedrunTools.dll`
  - You can usually find your `BONEWORKS` directory at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\BONEWORKS\BONEWORKS`

## Configuration

You can change some things (like where the boss claw moves to) by using MelonPreferencesManager:

- Install [MelonPreferencesManager](https://github.com/sinai-dev/MelonPreferencesManager) (download the IL2CPP version)
- Open the menu in-game using F5 to change config options

For boss claw settings to take effect you must restart the level.

In future I'll make the config appear in the BoneMenu:

- Install the [ModThatIsNotMod](https://boneworks.thunderstore.io/package/gnonme/ModThatIsNotMod/)
- Access BoneMenu through the in-game radial menu

Speedrun utilities for Stress Level Zero games.

## Structure

The speedrun mods are under `projects/GAMENAME`. Because the mod for every game has very similar code, features are generally built into the `projects/common` project which is used by each of the speedrun mods. This makes it easy to build a feature in one game then port it to the rest.

        <summary>Instructions for speedrunning Bonelab from Quest</summary>

        <h3>First time</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Install OBS on a computer</li>
          <li>
            In OBS:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Download the OBS scene from
                <a
                  href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jakzo/SlzMods/main/snippets/Obs/BonelabQuestObsScene.json"
                  download
                  >here</a
                >
              </li>
              <li>
                Scene Collection -> Import -> Select the downloaded
                `BonelabQuestObsScene.json`
              </li>
              <li>
                Select the `Quest Cast` source -> Click "Interact" -> Log in
              </li>
              <li>
                Select the `Livesplit` source -> Click "Interact" -> Click the
                "Select IP" button -> Enter your Quest's IP
              </li>
              <li>
                To find your Quest's IP: Open the Wifi menu in your Quest ->
                Select your network -> Scroll down to the advanced section
              </li>
              <li>
                Select the `Input Viewer` source -> Click "Interact" -> Press
                enter -> Enter your Quest's IP and press enter
              </li>
              <li>
                First time you click "Start streaming" you will need to log into
                a streaming platform
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Every time</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Open OBS</li>
          <li>On Quest:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Cast to computer</li>
            <li>Quest footage should now appear in OBS</li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            In OBS:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Select the `Quest Cast` source -> Click "Interact" -> Fullscreen
                the video and turn the sound up to full
              </li>
              <li>
                If input viewer (or Livesplit) isn't working, your Quest's IP
                address may have changed and you need to enter them again
              </li>
              <li>Click "Start Streaming" and follow prompts</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Quest casts at 1024x1024 resolution, 30fps, mono audio (I think?),
            ~1mbps bitrate (don't know exactly but it's low)
          </li>
          <li>Recording quality is higher than cast quality</li>
          <li>
            For decent quality on Youtube you should set the output resolution
            slightly higher to 1080x1080
          </li>
        </ul>
      </details>

        <summary>Browser warning that this site is insecure?</summary>
        <p>
          The tools on this site require using the unencrypted HTTP protocol
          (rather than the encrypted and secure HTTPS) due to browser security
          mechanisms not allowing these tools to function correctly.
          Specifically an HTTPS page cannot initiate a connection to an HTTP
          server, which is required in the case of the input viewer or Livesplit
          connecting to the non-HTTPS server created within the game to provide
          the inputs/splits.
        </p>
        <p>
          There should be no security risk for you, but here is what you should
          know to make up your own mind:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Because the connection to the site is unencrypted, any data sent
            between your machine and the server can be viewed by a "man in the
            middle" (your ISP, a hacker that has compromised a router, etc.)
          </li>
          <li>
            You should never send sensitive information (password, credit card
            number, etc.) to the server over an insecure connection just in case
            someone is listening
          </li>
          <li>
            There are no features on this website for sending sensitive
            information to the server
          </li>
          <li>
            Things like inputs and splits sent from your game to the page,
            although not encrypted, go directly from the game to the page
            running in your browser, meaning they are not sent to the server and
            will not go through the internet (and they are not sensitive
            information anyway)
          </li>
          <li>
            If you're technically inclined you can
            <a href="https://github.com/jakzo/SlzMods"
              >view the source code on Github</a
            >, verify that the mod you downloaded was published by the action in
            this repo, inspect the site with dev tools, etc. for reassurance it
            is not doing anything malicious
          </li>

Shows the headset view during loading screens instead of a still image.

# Installation

- Make sure [Melon Loader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=what-is-melonloader) is installed in Bonelab
  - To install Melon Loader for Quest follow the [instructions here](https://github.com/LemonLoader/MelonLoader/wiki/Installation)
  - For PC: Patch 3 or before must use Melon Loader 0.5.x and patch 4 onwards must use 0.6.x
  - For Quest: Lemon Loader currently installs Melon Loader 0.5.x (and works with patch 4)
- Download [the mod from Thunderstore](https://bonelab.thunderstore.io/package/jakzo/LoadMirror/) (click on "Manual Download")
- Open the downloaded `.zip` file and open the folder corresponding to your game and Melon Loader version
- Extract the `Mods/LoadMirror.Px.MLx.dll` file into `BONELAB/Mods/LoadMirror.Px.MLx.dll` which is usually at:
  - Steam: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\BONELAB\BONELAB`
  - Oculus: `C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software\stress-level-zero-inc-bonelab`
  - Quest: `/sdcard/Android/data/com.StressLevelZero.BONELAB/files`

## Why?

Speedruns require videos including the headset view of loading screens to make splicing harder. This mod allows people to record the game window instead of setting up SteamVR or Oculus mirrors which reduce performance and can even be impossible to do in some situations (eg. using Virtual Desktop on Quest to play the Oculus version of the game). It also allows recording speedruns using the fisheye spectator camera with motion smoothing.

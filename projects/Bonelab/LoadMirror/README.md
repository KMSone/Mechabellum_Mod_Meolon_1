Shows the headset view during loading screens instead of a still image.

# Installation

- Make sure [Melon Loader](https://melonwiki.xyz/#/?id=what-is-melonloader) version 0.5.7 or newer is installed in Bonelab
  - To install Melon Loader for Quest follow the [instructions here](https://github.com/LemonLoader/MelonLoader/wiki/Installation)
- Download [the mod from Thunderstore](https://bonelab.thunderstore.io/package/jakzo/LoadMirror/) (click on "Manual Download")
- Open the downloaded `.zip` file and extract `Mods/LoadMirror.dll` into `BONELAB/Mods/LoadMirror.dll` which is usually at:
  - Steam: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\BONELAB\BONELAB`
  - Oculus: `C:\Program Files\Oculus\Software\Software\stress-level-zero-inc-bonelab`
  - Quest: `/sdcard/Android/data/com.StressLevelZero.BONELAB/files`

## Why?

Speedruns require videos including the headset view of loading screens to make splicing harder. This mod allows people to record the game window instead of setting up SteamVR or Oculus mirrors which reduce performance and can even be impossible to do in some situations (eg. using Virtual Desktop on Quest to play the Oculus version of the game). It also allows recording speedruns using the fisheye spectator camera with motion smoothing.

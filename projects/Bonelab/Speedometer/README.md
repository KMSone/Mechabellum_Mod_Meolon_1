Shows how fast you're moving.

# Usage

Displays your speed in meters per second over your left hand. It supports averaging your speed over a period of time so that you can measure the average speed of inconsistent movement (eg. bhopping). You can change the average speed window duration by editing the setting in `MelonPreferences.cfg`.

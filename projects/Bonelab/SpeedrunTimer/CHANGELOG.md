## 1.2.0

A few quality of life updates, particularly for Quest:

- On Quest deleting all game data from the main menu no longer deletes your mods (so you don't need to use a PC to add the SpeedrunTimer after each run)
- Tweaked styling of loading screen text to make it more readable
- Deleted the IL option since you can use the splits view now

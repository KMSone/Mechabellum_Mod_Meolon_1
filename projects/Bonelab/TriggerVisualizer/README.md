Visibly shows areas which trigger something (eg. level finish) in the game.

# Usage

Press the `T` key on the keyboard while the game window is focussed to toggle trigger visualizations.

Note that this currently doesn't show all triggers, just ones which use the `TriggerLasers` class (eg. the finish of Mine Dive won't display) and only if they use a `BoxCollider`.

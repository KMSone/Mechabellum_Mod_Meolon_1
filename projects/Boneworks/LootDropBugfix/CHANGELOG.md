## 2.0.0

Found the actual source of the bug and rewrote the mod to patch the broken method. Experimentally verified by breaking 8k+ ammo boxes with a script (included in this mod under the `test` configuration option).


## 1.3.0

Items are now indestructible before load finishes (to prevent the bonebox in Runoff breaking). Also adds a setting to test ammo drops (continuously teleports ammo crates to the player and breaks them until a loot drop bug is encountered).

## 1.2.0

Fixes. Everything *should* work now.

## 1.1.3

Fix spawning replacements

## 1.1.2

Handle loot spawning before loading finishes.

## 1.1.1

Fix bad loot chance calculation.

## 1.1.0

Make replacement items saveable and log warnings on replacement.

## 1.0.0

Initial release.

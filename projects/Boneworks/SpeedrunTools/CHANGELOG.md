## 2.5.3

For the 100% status LiveSplit component: it will no longer show a level item as missing if you skip it during the run if you collected it in a previous level.

For example: the default collectible order includes the Hover Junkers module in Tower. If you collect it in Streets instead, it would previously say you missed it if you skipped it during Tower (since you already had it and don't need to reclaim it again) but will not anymore.

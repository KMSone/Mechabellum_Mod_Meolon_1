- Run Boneworks with current SteamVR
- To find loading indicator address:
  - Scan for 0 while not loading, 1 while loading
- Right click -> Find what accesses it
  - 3 spots come up
    - `rdi+C65`, `rdi+C64`, etc...
  - Open the `C65` one in disassembler
    - `vrclient_x64.dll+1002A9 - cmp byte ptr [rdi+00000C65],00`
    - `rdi = 7FFC39FD8C98`
  - Set breakpoint
  - Find where `rdi` is set
    - `vrclient_x64.dll+FF50A - mov rdi,rcx`
    - `rcx = 7FFC39FD8C98`
  - Find where `rcx` is set
    - Not in this function so step out
    - `UnityPlayer.dll+4DBCBC - mov rcx,[rcx+00000118]`
  - I thought I found it after stepping out but after verifying rcx was the expected value with the debugger, turns out it wasn't
    - Had to step into the call and find when rcx is updated to the expected value
  - Found it here and this is the flow from the fixed offset within vrclient_x64.dll to the loading indicator:
    - `vrclient_x64.dll+A9887 - lea rcx,[vrclient_x64.dll+3CAEB8]`
      - rcx after = 7FFC39FD8C98
    - `vrclient_x64.dll+8E080 - mov rcx,[rcx+08]`
      - rcx before = 7FFC39FBAEB8
      - rcx after = 7FFC39FD8C98
    - `vrclient_x64.dll+FF50A - mov rdi,rcx`
      - rcx before = 7FFC39FD8C98
      - rdi after = 7FFC39FD8C98
    - `vrclient_x64.dll+1002A9 - cmp byte ptr [rdi+00000C65],00`
      - rdi before = 7FFC39FD8C98
      - cmp (final value) = 7FFC39FD98FD
- Ghidra
  - Import vrclient_x64.dll into a Ghidra project (auto analyse)
  - Downgrade SteamVR and import the old version of vrclient_x64.dll into the same project
  - For each of the versions:
    - Find the fixed offset above in the file (`vrclient_x64.dll+3CAEB8`) by: - Noting the file offset from the Cheat Engine disassembler (`A9887`) - Adding this to the Ghidra base address (`1800A9887`) - Navigate -> Go to -> the address and you should see the same code
    - Right click on the fixed offset (`DAT_1803caeb8`) -> find references
    - Skim through the references of both the new and old versions until you find a spot which best matches these criteria:
      - Exists in both new and old version
      - Unique looking surrounding code (to make the sigscan target more unique)
      - Surrounding code is the same in both new and old version
      - Generates a small AOB
      - AOB matches both new and old version
    - We will look for this spot to sigscan and find the fixed offset
- Find the spot from Ghidra in the Cheat Engine disassembler
  - Right click on a line inside the disassembler -> Go to address
  - Calculate full address by subtracting relative address of line from full address of line then adding relative address from Ghidra
- Tools -> Generate AOB lua script
- Paste AOB into autosplitter
- Log found address to see if it's working
